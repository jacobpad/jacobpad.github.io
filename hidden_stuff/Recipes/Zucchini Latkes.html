            <p>The trick to crispy latkes made of zucchini is getting as much water out of the zucchini as possible. I like to take a two-step dehydration approach: salt and squeeze. It takes a little more time on the front end, but you can prep the zucchini a day ahead—which I highly recommend. That way, when it’s time to fry these up and serve them, you’re not held up with all the legwork. After all, these are meant to be served at gatherings and celebrations, and you want to enjoy the party!<br/></p>

    <!-- Directions -->

        <h3 class="subhead">Directions</h3>
        <div itemprop="recipeInstructions" class="directions text">
            <p class="line">Place the grated zucchini in a colander and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of the salt. Let it sit for 30 minutes in the sink or over a bowl, as it will release water. Drain the zucchini by tossing it in the colander, then transfer it to a nut milk bag or clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much water as possible—it should release somewhere between ¾ and 1 cup of water. You should end up with approximately 1½ cups of dehydrated grated zucchini. </p><p class="line">Place the grated zucchini in a large bowl. Add the onions (be sure to pat it dry first to soak up any excess liquid they may have released during grating). Add the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt, eggs, coconut flour, and garlic powder to the bowl and mix to combine. It will create a moist dough. If there is liquid pooling, sprinkle in a little more coconut flour and fold until the liquid is absorbed. </p><p class="line">In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the coconut oil. It should be about ½ inch deep. When a wooden spoon inserted into the coconut oil sizzles, it’s ready for frying. </p><p class="line">Form the latke batter into ten 1-inch balls. Working in batches (don’t overcrowd the skillet), add them to the oil one at a time, gently flattening them with the back of a spoon as you go. Fry for 3 minutes, gently flip them with a spatula, and fry on the other side for another 3 minutes. Remove the latkes from the oil and place on a cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining latkes. </p><p class="line">Serve immediately with coconut yogurt, pistou, or marinara, or freeze immediately. (I do not recommend eating these as leftovers, as they will get soggy.) To freeze, set the latkes on a sheet pan, rack, or plate and freeze for 2 hours, then transfer to a freezer bag. They will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, bake in a preheated 400°F oven for 10 minutes.</p>
