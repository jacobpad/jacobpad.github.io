# Deeptunes!  

Deeptunes! is a project that I got to participate in during a crossfunctional build in Lambda School. We had four days to put this together from scratch. I got to be a part of this build while simultaneously going through training to be a Team Lead to help and serve other students.

Deeptunes! is a song similarity finder from a dataset we used containing songs from the Spotify API. 

Here's a quick video, time stamped to the spot where the app is explained.

Enjoy!
