# Earthquakes - Magnitude, Depth & The 5 Biggest From 12/29/19 - 1/28/20

I was curious about what relationships I could find with different information about earthquakes. 
So I went to a standard for collecting information, the United States Government. From here, I was 
able to obtain information about earthquakes that ranged from December 29th, 2019 to January 28th, 2020. 
As of now, they have even more recent information, but this is what I collected when I got it on January 28th.

<br>
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacobpad/jacobpad.github.io/master/data/all_month.csv">My sample I used.</a>
<br>

 After manipulating the data to the way I wanted it, I was able to easily count that there were 
 <strong>11,961 earthquakes</strong> recorded during that 30-day time frame. That many earthquakes 
 all around the world equate to just over <strong>398 earthquakes per day.</strong> That's insane! 
 Granted, a large majority of them were not significant. As in, they likely weren't even felt by humans. 
 There were 9,309 earthquakes with less than a 2.5 magnitude. That's 77.82% of quakes less than a 2.5 magnitude.

 This is what the earthquakes look like for the month mentioned above. Thousands of earthquakes fall within the range 
 between 0 and 2.5 magnitude.

 Does the depth of an earthquake matter? Not really. The graph below may seem a little bit misleading if 
 you were trying to measure the depth versus magnitude. However, if you take into account the fact that 
 there are fewer earthquakes as magnitude increases, there's less information to getbecause there's less quakes. 
 For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Peru_earthquake">8.0 earthquake in Peru during 2019</a>
 measured a depth of 122 kilometers, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami">
 9.0 Japan quake in 2011</a> was 29 kilometers deep. It's important to remember the following is the averages of each
 starting with earthquakes in the 2.5 to 3.0 magnitude range.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of earthquakes:
    
Earthquakes between 2.5 - 2.9 total: 1126  
The average earthquake magnitude is: 2.6
    
Earthquakes between 3 - 3.4 total: 383  
The average earthquake magnitude is: 3.1
    
Earthquakes between 3.5 - 3.9 total: 169  
The average earthquake magnitude is: 3.6
    
Earthquakes between 4 - 4.4 total: 352  
The average earthquake magnitude is: 4.2
    
Earthquakes between 4.5 - 4.9 total: 322  
The average earthquake magnitude is: 4.6
    
Earthquakes between 5 - 5.4 total: 109  
The average earthquake magnitude is: 5.1
    
Earthquakes between 5.5 - 5.9 total: 26  
The average earthquake magnitude is: 5.5
    
Earthquakes between 6 - 6.4 total: 12  
The average earthquake magnitude is: 6.1
    
Earthquakes between 6.5 - 6.9 total: 1  
The average earthquake magnitude is: 6.7
    
Earthquakes between 7 - 7.4 total: 0  
The average earthquake magnitude is: none
    
Earthquakes between 7.5 - 7.9 total: 1  
The average earthquake magnitude is: 7.7
    
Earthquakes between 8 - 8.4 total: 0  
The average earthquake magnitude is: none
    
Earthquakes between 8.5 - 8.9 total: 0  
The average earthquake magnitude is: none
    
Earthquakes between 9 - 9.4 total: 0  
The average earthquake magnitude is: none
    
9.5+: 0

## The 5 biggest quakes from December 29th, 2019 to January 28th, 2020

Where the biggest five are earthquakes located? Thanks to the USGS site providing all kinds of 
information about them, I was able to plot the coordinates of the five highest magnitude quakes.

This skill took me a substancial amount of time to learn, but in all it's beauty here is a showing 
of the 5 biggest quakes that finished out the year 2019 and shook in the year 2020.
